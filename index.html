        <div class="subheading mb-5">Psychology MajorðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Marvin Ochoa. I am an 18 years old but although I am young I consider myself to be responsible and diligent just as any adult. Previously I have had multiple job opportunities which in many cases many thought questioned my encouragement toward the responsibility. I can say that multiple times I have been able to prove them wrong by being motivated to display my skills for them. On the other hand on some occasion I have failed in these tasks which have not caused me to bow my head but to raise it higher in order to continue to learn and improve myself. <br><br>

       Currently I am attending the University of California, Riverside with many responsibilities such as completing homework assignments, studying for exams, as well as attending lectures and discussion. To add to that, I am also working which takes up a grand amount of my time throughout the week. What many people think is that as a student this would hinder me from functioning at 100 percent but in reality it is a catalyst which helps me thrive to work and learn to the best of my abilities. By taking on these tasks I have learned to adapt in difficult circumstances and have also learned to look onward and not just at the task at hand. Having both a job and education is very difficult to handle at times but the upside of it is knowing how not only I will benefit from this but so many others. I am aware of that many times the result will not be in my favor but knowing that I was able to get an opportunity in any profession allows me to acknowledge that perhaps the next time the result will improve. That has always been my goal not to succeed and take glory but to acknowledge my mistakes in order to form them into victories.  <br><br>

        I am aware that I am still at a young age before I can really call myself a professional. Nonetheless these small steps which I have taken have allowed me to have an advantage which not many have in starting their careers. I do believe one day I will have my bachelors degree but for now I must concentrate on what's important which is learning from others more experienced than me in order to grow as they did. My eagerness to continue to grow will not only allow employers to seek my employment but allow me to be placed in a career in which I can help others benefit. To conclude the attitude and the eagerness in which I apply to everyday tasks will not only allow me to contribute to my career and work my way up the ladder to perhaps a managerial position. With that being said I hope this allows those who read my resume to comprehend what type of a worker or student I am. Hopefully my words have been of use and allow me to be presented with a career.
